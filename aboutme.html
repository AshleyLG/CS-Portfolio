    <h5><p><font color= "black">My name is Ashley i go to Everest High School
    i'm a freshman 9th gradei have gone around California
    and Peru.Two of my favorite things is music i got into 
    music with my brother he listened a lot of this music 
    and so i got use to it and actually like it. I also like
    animation characters like Pucca a chinese character in a 
    old show andn rimikku i also like anime because it helps
    me with my reading cause you have to read the subtitles 
    unless you are not going to understand what the characters
    are saying so that helps me in reading i got into anime with
    my friend and i liked it but pucca i found out about pucca 
    when i was 8 or 9 and the show was on TV and then i went to
    Peru for the summer and it had the same TV show but in spanish
    so then i went the store in Peru with my mom and they sold 
    keychains with pucca on it and my mom bought it for me and i
    kept watching pucca until they canceled the show and started 
       to put new shows and so i found internet and a website called youtube and music/pucca on it </p></font></ul></h5>
